#Restaurent Sentiment Analysis 

#AGENDA

As the influence of the social media and internet is increasing in ones life there arises a need to analyse the valuable insights from the data scattered over the internet in various forms. Business like restaurants can use this data to find out how they are performing and find out what are the reviews of their customers and know what their customers are really thinking of them. Our goal is to create a AI algorithm that finds the sentiment of a user from its review and distinguish it between two categories either positive or negative. This can be really beneficial for the restaurants to gain insights and also to recognise which dish is performing best, what are the areas to work on, what are the negative points. Using this knowledge they can upgrade themselves so that they can perform well on their customers.

#PROJECT OVERVIEW

Restaurant reviews are a valuable source of information for potential customers, but they can be time-consuming and difficult to analyse manually. This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model that can automatically classify restaurant reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The model will be developed using a supervised machine learning approach, and it will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall. This project has the potential to benefit both restaurant owners and customers. Restaurant owners can use the model to identify areas where they can improve their service or food quality. Customers can use the model to quickly and easily find restaurants that are likely to meet their needs. The project will be completed in three phases:

DATA PROCESSING --> MODEL TRAINING --> MODEL EVALUATION

#USERS 

The users of the sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews project are:

Restaurant owners: Restaurant owners can use the model to identify areas where they can improve their service or food quality. For example, if the model identifies that many negative reviews mention slow service, the restaurant owner can take steps to improve the speed of service.

Customers: Customers can use the model to quickly and easily find restaurants that are likely to meet their needs. For example, if a customer is looking for a restaurant with good food, they can use the model to find restaurants that have mostly positive reviews.

#RESULTS

Extra Trees Classifier Algorithm is the best algorithm amongst all the algorithm used for this dataset with the highest accuracy score of 81%
The model was accurate to predict the results for different inputs.

KNeighbours Classifier Algorithm is the worst algorithm amongst all the algorithm used for this dataset with the lowest accuracy score of 67.5%.
